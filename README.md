Artificial Intelligence Educational Fruit Game

This project has been developed to create an Educational Fruit Game aimed at facilitating the English learning process for children in their developmental stage in a fun and educational manner. Through this game, children will have the opportunity to learn English while also enhancing their hand-eye coordination. The current score and the name of the fruit are displayed in the top left corner of the game. By matching the displayed fruit with the corresponding hand gesture, children can earn +1 point. If they fail to make a match, -1 point will be reflected on the screen. Artificial intelligence is utilized in this project through image processing, which involves detecting hand gestures, to create a seamless gaming experience
